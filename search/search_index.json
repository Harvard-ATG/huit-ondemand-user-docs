For example, if you install one version of a package, load it with a <code>spack load</code> command in your <code>.bashrc</code> file, and later install another version of the same package, then the <code>spack load</code> command in your <code>.bashrc</code> can suddenly stop working. Environments have an internal lock file that articulates the exact packages that are loaded, so they're safe to load from a <code>.bashrc</code> file or in an automated script. When Spack is required for an interactive application, we use Spack environments for this reason.</p> <p>The Spack documentation provides a tutorial on environments, which is useful for a more comprehensive understanding of how these environments function. In this documentation, we'll take a more focused approach, dealing with common setup and installation tasks for preparing an environment for a course.</p> <p>You can only set up environments in environments that you can modify. In HUIT Open OnDemand, that means that you can only set up environments in your own personal Spack installation in your home folder, or in a shared course folder.
